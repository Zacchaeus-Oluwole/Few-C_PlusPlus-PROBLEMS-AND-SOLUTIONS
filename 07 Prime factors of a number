// The prime factors of a positive integer are the prime numbers that divide that integer
// exactly. For instance, the prime factors of 8 are 2 x 2 x 2, and the prime factors of 42 are 2 x 3
// x 7. To determine the prime factors you should use the following algorithm:
// 1. While n is divisible by 2, 2 is a prime factor and must be added to the list,
// while n becomes the result of n/2 . After completing this step, n is an odd
// number.
// 2. Iterate from 3 to the square root of n . While the current number, let’s call it i ,
// divides n , i is a prime factor and must be added to the list, while n becomes the
// result of n/i . When i no longer divides n , increment i by 2 (to get the next odd
// number).
// 3. When n is a prime number greater than 2, the steps above will not result
// in n becoming 1. Therefore, if at the end of step 2 n is still greater than 2, then n is
// a prime factor.
